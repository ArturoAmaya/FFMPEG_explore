00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to a script made for UCSD's online master's classes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Every snippet here represents something that will be said by the avatar.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Whenever you want to change slides simply use two backslashes together, like so.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That will change the slides.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Slides are provided in the header individually, for now.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Please make sure the number of slides is the number of backslashes plus one.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The contents of the slides are, for now, not dynamic.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know how to parse things yet.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I am still trying to learn more on the subject.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can however use the basic Python string manipulation functions to streamline my process.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It has become too annoying to do in Postman.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There are few things I still have to consider.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The new Heygen API seems to be more possible.
